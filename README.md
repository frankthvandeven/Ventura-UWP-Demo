# Ventura-UWP-Demo
Source code for Ventura UWP Demo and the Ventura UWP Framework.

The repository contains 2 Visual Studio 2019 projects: VenturaUWP and VenturaUWPDemo.

The VenturaUWP project is the framework. It contains some pretty advanced UWP controls and more.

The VenturaUWPDemo project demonstrates the capabilities of the framework. The demo uses a SqlLite database. For data access the Ventura SQL product was used.

The VenturaUWPDemo.venproj file contains the recordset definitions. Download and Install Ventura SQL from venturatools.com, and then open the venproj file with "Ventura SQL Studio."

A compiled version of the Ventura UWP Demo app can be downloaded from the Microsoft Store
